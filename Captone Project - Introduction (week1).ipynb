They want to see all the main sites of a city that they have never visited before but at the same time, for whatever reaons unknown, they want to be able to do all that they can to make sure that they stay clear of trouble i.e. is it safe to visit this venue and this restaurant at 4:00 pm in the afternoon.\n\n\nThere are many data science aspect of this project including:\n\n    Data Acquisition\n    Data Cleansing\n    Data Analysis\n    Machine Learning\n    Prediction\n"
